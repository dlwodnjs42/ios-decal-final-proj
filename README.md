#TimeFeed

## Authors
* Jae Lee

##Purpose
* Think about Facebook statuses, they're not really what it was made for: it's basically too "high-key" to post statuses about what i'm doing right now(Lets say i post about "lets get boba" in my status, they'll think wow, this guy has no friends/ you have the fear of having no likes." The purpose of Timefeed is to casually let other people know what your doing and what you're going to be doing in the near future.
